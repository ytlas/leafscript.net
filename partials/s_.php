<p>Leafscript is a community consisting of long-time friends and random bypassers. It was founded in 2014 as a project to host TTT servers on Garry's Mod but those servers were later shut down because I grew tired of the game and community. LeafScript is now a group of people residing in our public TeamSpeak 3 server which has been up since the start. Connect to leafscript.net on TeamSpeak 3 to join. If you're wondering what the purpose of this website is, I don't have a clear answer for you. I develop it using PHP learning about authentication, security etc. If you want to register an account and try things out, maybe even pen-test it, go ahead.</p>

<p>FYI!!!: Every request to this website gets logged with your ip address, date of request and the request URI. This is for statistics and in case anyone tries to penetrate the site somehow, this way I have some information about what happened and from where.</p>
